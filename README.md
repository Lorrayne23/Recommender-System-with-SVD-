# Recommender System with SVD
This project was based on the tutorial https://machinelearningmastery.com/using-singular-value-decomposition-to-build-a-recommender-system/.

* Considering that the link in the repository is no longer working, was used the same data but downloaded it from another website. To download the real dataset used in this repository, it is necessary  to click on this link: https://datarepo.eng.ucsd.edu/mcauley_group/data/librarything/lthing_data.tar.gz

* The archive must be put in the SVD folder to be executed.
* Another change was made  since the data collected offers only a reviews.txt file different from the one used in the tutorial, a JSON file named reviews.json.

* During the exploration of the file, it was discovered that it wasn't necessary to convert the TXT file to JSON. But changes were made it to execute the entire process.
